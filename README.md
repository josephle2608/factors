# Life Expectancy Prediction
How do we determine the life quality of a country? Which issues that a country need to improve to provide a better life quality for people? The project will work on a dataset which is collected from most countries in the world. Base on data analysis for the dataset, we could know which predictors could affect life expectancy of a country. Base on the predictors, a country should know how they could make a better life quality. This is the link to the dataset and its variablesâ€™ descriptions:
